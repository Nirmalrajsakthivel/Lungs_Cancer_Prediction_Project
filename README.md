# ü´Å Lung Cancer Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to predict the likelihood of lung cancer based on various health and lifestyle attributes such as smoking, anxiety, peer pressure, and more.

## üìå Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of death globally. Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes. This project applies supervised machine learning to classify whether a person is likely to have lung cancer based on the input data.

üìä Dataset
The dataset consists of 309 patient records and 16 features including symptoms and health habits.

üîΩ How to Upload the Dataset
The dataset is required for training the model. Use one of the following options:

‚úÖ Option 1: Dataset Included
If you have cloned the repository, the dataset is already present in the data/ folder:

Path: data/lung_cancer_dataset.csv

Make sure the dataset path in the script matches this:

df = pd.read_csv("data/lung_cancer_dataset.csv")

‚úÖ Option 2: Manual Upload
If the dataset is not present, you can download it here and place it inside a data/ directory:

Precision & Recall: ~98.3%
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("data/lung_cancer_dataset.csv")

# Convert categorical values
df['GENDER'] = df['GENDER'].map({'M': 1, 'F': 0})

df['LUNG_CANCER'] = df['LUNG_CANCER'].map({'YES': 1, 'NO': 0})

# Features and label
X = df.drop("LUNG_CANCER", axis=1)

y = df["LUNG_CANCER"]

# Train/Test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Prediction example
sample = [[1, 65, 2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2]]

prediction = model.predict(sample)

print("Prediction:", prediction)

The person does not have lung cancer.
